#Name of your plugin. This is self-explanatory. Plugin names SHOULD NOT contain spaces.
name: %{PluginName}

#Fully-qualified class-name of your plugin's main class. This is usually the one that extends PluginBase.
#Since PocketMine-MP's autoloader is PSR-0, your plugin's main-class namespace will usually be the same as the folder path.
main: %{Namespace}\Main

#Version name/number of your plugin
version: 0.0.1

#API version that your plugin supports. If your plugin's API is not compatible with that of the server, the server will refuse to load your plugin.
#The API version is changed when:
# - Breaking changes are made to a development version, things that might cause your plugin to crash.
#     This is denoted by an API suffix, for example 3.0.0-ALPHA4. If the version does not match as a whole on a development version, the plugin will not be loaded. (Suffixes are non-case-sensitive.)
# - Breaking changes are made to a release version, things that might cause your plugin to crash.
#     This usually warrants a major API bump, e.g. 2.0.0 -> 3.0.0. If the major version does not match, the plugin will not be loaded.
# - Feature additions which do not break existing plugins.
#     This is denoted by a minor API bump, e.g. 2.0.0 -> 2.1.0. The server will load plugins with an equivalent or older minor version.
# - Minor bug fixes or insignificant alterations to the API.
#     This is denoted by a patch bump, e.g. 1.13.0 -> 1.13.1

#When to load the plugin. There are currently two options for this: STARTUP and POSTWORLD. Usually POSTWORLD will do fine.
